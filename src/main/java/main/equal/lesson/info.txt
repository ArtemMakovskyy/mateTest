Given class — Rectangle. Override it's methods equals()
and hashCode() so, equals() compares Rectangle objects
by it's fields: color, width and length. Also make
sure that hashCode() follows the contract between
equals and hashcode.



Reflexive: x.equals(x) == true , an object must equal to itself.
Symmetry: if(x.equals(y) == true) then y.equals(x) == true.
Transitive: if x.equals(y) and y.equals(z); then x.equals(z).
Consistent: if x.equals(y) == true and no value is modified, then it’s always true for every call
For any non-null object x, x.equals(null) == false.
